## JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

      To write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. 

Rendering Table (table renders without error on page load; table includes all columns; clears table before rendering again; table re-renders with filtered data).

Filtering Data (event handler calls a function to filter the data; successfully grabs in the input value; correctly uses the filter method to get the new table data based off the given input; prevents the page from reloading using D3; code is able to handle five total filters at ones; the multi-filtered data is then rendered back to the table)
